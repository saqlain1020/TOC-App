## Product Vision:
In the advancing world of today, the one thing that's of too much value is being effective. Our app allows the users to share their profile links effectively saving time and without the need of a business card. Everyone has their Mobile with them every time so essentially they have all their profiles with them all the time. It’s easy to manage because there is no need to keep stacks of business cards with you all the time. You will get to know about our product better by reading the following feature points:

- Manage all the profile links in one place.
- Able to share both URLs and QR code links.
- Star your profiles and add them to your favourites.
- Swippy stickers send a notification to open a profile just on the tap of your phones.

Unlike popl, swippy allows you to share QR Code along with URL links where as the former allows only URL links.

We have to accept that it’s not that easy to manage multiple profiles so if a user prefers a certain profile, they can star it and turn the “Direct” option On, which allows others to instantly open the preferred profile of the user straight from the notification pop-up.
